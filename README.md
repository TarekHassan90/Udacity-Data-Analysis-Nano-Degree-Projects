#Project: Explore and Summarize Data Using R:
Using either a Udacity-provided dataset, or your own, you are asked to perform exploratory data analysis while documenting all your thoughts and decisions, while creating “quick and dirty” visualizations. In the final section, you are asked to highlight your main findings, and most important aspects of the data.

#Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data:
The point of this project is for you to gather, assess and clean data related to tweets from the @WeRateDogs Twitter account. You are also asked to store, analyze and visualize your wrangled data, and then report on your data wrangling efforts and your data analysis and visualizations.

#Project: Create a Tableau Story:
In this project, using either a Udacity supplied data-set or your own, you are asked to create data visualizations using Tableau. The point is to explore data visually — to find and then tell an interesting story.
